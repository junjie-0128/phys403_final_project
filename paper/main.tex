\begin{abstract}
    In this paper we consider a method for estimating the Hubble constant based on ``dark sirens'', gravitational wave observations which do not have a known electromagnetic counterpart. This method has already been applied to the event GW170814, but more observations are needed to constrain $H_0$ sufficiently to resolve the discrepancy between estimates produced by the Planck collaboration using high-redshift measurements of the cosmic microwave background and those produced by Riess et al. using low-redshift measurements of type Ia Supernovae. Using simulated events based on existing gravitational wave detections, we are able to estimate that $90$ observations of black hole mergers are needed to measure $H_0$ to an uncertainty of $5$ \si{km.s^{-1}.Mpc^{-1}}.
