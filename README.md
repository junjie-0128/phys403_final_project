# phys403_final_project
Final project for Physics 403, an estimation of H_0 using GW data.

##Simulating gravitational wave (GW) events based on existing GW test result and using a further confirmed value of $H_0$.
-Building Bayesian framework to write the posterior distribution for $H_0$ for data analysis, and calculating the standard deviation obtained from the posterior as a function of number of localized events used and the deviation between the injected known value of $H_0$ and our expectation value.
